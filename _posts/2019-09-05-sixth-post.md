Hello 

```yaml
layout: post
title: Post with Intro
author: Guest Author
intro: This is the introduction text for this post. It appears large and bold at the top of the post
intro_image: /img/route66.jpg
intro_image_ratio: is-16by9
```

Only the intro is required if you want to display it. If you don't want an image then don't specify one and just the intro text will display.
